# Life Expectancy and GDP Project

This project analyzes the relationship between **GDP** (Gross Domestic Product) and **Life Expectancy** across six countries using data from the **World Health Organization (WHO)** and the **World Bank**.

## 📊 Project Goals
- Explore whether higher GDP is associated with longer life expectancy.  
- Visualize how GDP and life expectancy have changed from 2000 to 2015.  
- Identify trends and exceptions among the six countries studied.

## 🗂️ Dataset
- **File:** `all_data.csv`  
- **Columns:**  
  - `Country`  
  - `Year`  
  - `Life expectancy at birth (years)`  
  - `GDP`  

## 🔎 Analysis & Visualizations
The notebook `life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb` includes:
- Line plots of **Life Expectancy over Time (2000–2015)**.  
- Line plots of **GDP over Time (2000–2015)**.  
- Scatter plots showing **GDP vs Life Expectancy**.  
- Distribution plots of life expectancy values.  

## ✅ Key Findings
- Life expectancy increased steadily in most countries, especially **Zimbabwe** which had the lowest values but improved significantly after 2005.  
- GDP showed strong growth in **China** and steady increases in the **USA** and **Germany**.  
- There is a clear positive correlation between GDP and life expectancy overall.  

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Git & GitHub for version control
